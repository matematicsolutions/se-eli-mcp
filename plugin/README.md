# se-eli-mcp - Claude plugin

Swedish law with verifiable citations, as a Claude plugin. It runs the
[se-eli-mcp](https://github.com/matematicsolutions/se-eli-mcp) MCP server, version 0.3.3
from PyPI. `uv.lock`, next to the manifest, pins that package and every dependency with
hashes. The plugin starts it with `uvx se-eli-mcp==0.3.3`, and Claude Code's locked launch
installs exactly the set in `uv.lock`, so it runs what was reviewed. (Run by hand outside
Claude Code, plain `uvx` resolves the dependency ranges from PyPI instead.) Every
answer carries the official source, so a citation can be checked instead of trusted.

What it covers: the Swedish Code of Statutes (SFS) through the Riksdag's open-data API (data.riksdagen.se): search, and a consolidated act's metadata and text by SFS number. The full tool list is in the
[main README](https://github.com/matematicsolutions/se-eli-mcp#readme).

## Requirements

Claude Code or the Claude desktop app, and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) on your
machine (its `uvx` installs the locked packages on first start and runs the server).

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add matematicsolutions/se-eli-mcp
/plugin install se-eli-mcp@se-eli-mcp
```

## Data

The server runs on your machine. Each tool call sends your query to the Riksdag's open-data API (data.riksdagen.se)
and to nothing else; nothing goes to MateMatic. Your query and the results also pass
through whatever model you use, the same way as any other message.

The standalone server can fetch a small configuration file (updated source addresses) from
this repository's GitHub Releases on first use. The plugin turns that off
(`SE_ELI_RUNTIME_URL` set to empty in `plugin.json`), so it runs only the reviewed code with
its built-in source addresses and makes no request other than the tool calls above.

Two things are written locally, in your home directory:

- a response cache (`~/.matematic/cache/se-eli`), so a repeated lookup does not hit
  the source again. The sources are published legislation.
- an audit log (`~/.matematic/audit/se-eli-mcp.jsonl`), one line per tool call: the
  tool name, a SHA-256 hash of the input (not the input itself), result size, time
  and status.

Delete either folder at any time; `SE_ELI_CACHE_DIR` and `SE_ELI_AUDIT_DIR` move them.
